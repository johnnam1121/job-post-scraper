Website job post scraper using python

Job post website scraper using python and beautifulsoup4 and selenium to run some scripts.
The goal is to have the program search through specific website of some companies websites and find jobs that are relevant to me to apply to. It will search job titles based on some keywords and print the title, location, and link to apply.

This is more efficient for me than scanning through indeed or linkedin which has a lot of unrelated/spammy jobs.
